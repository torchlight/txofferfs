txofferfs: A python-fuse filesystem for accessing txoffer DDL listings


I wrote the code in early 2016, and it is now 2020 as I write this readme; I do not know if any txoffer instances still exist at all, so this is likely completely useless. I don't even remember how to use this.

Requires Python 2 and probably an old version of python-fuse. Try at your own risk. (Unmounting is janky; you may need to reboot if the usual unmounting methods don't work.)
